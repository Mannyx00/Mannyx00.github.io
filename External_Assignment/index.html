            <p class="clearfix"><img src="Images/FB_IMG_1700264520377.jpg" alt="picture of the owner"> She was born in southern Louisiana near New Orleans. I love to cook and satisfy others through the love of my cooking. I learned to cook at a very young age for my siblings while my parents worked. I always dreamed and told myself that one day I would open up my own restaurant, not only for business purposes, but also to show off what I love to do. I started off cooking and selling food in my local neighborhood and those in my neighborhood loved my cooking to where I decided to expand and make a name for myself. I took a leap out on faith back in 2010 to where I had the assistance and support of my daughter.</p>
